Automate Arnold AOV Light Grouping in Maya with a Custom Tool
Managing AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) for lighting in Autodesk Maya, especially when working with Arnold, can become a tedious task—particularly in complex scenes with numerous lights. To simplify this workflow, I developed a custom Python tool with a clean, user-friendly UI that allows artists to quickly assign AOV light group names to multiple lights in just a few clicks.

The "Arnold Auto Light Group Naming Pro" tool helps you batch-assign AOV group names using a customizable prefix (e.g., multiLight00, multiLight01, etc.). You can choose to assign groups to all lights in the scene or only to selected lights, and filter by light type—Arnold lights, standard Maya lights, or both. When using the "Only Selected Lights" option, the tool assigns a new incremented group ID each time you run it, allowing logical grouping of lights for layered compositing workflows.

The intuitive interface includes:

Prefix customization to define your AOV group name structure.

Light filters to target specific light types.

Selected lights grouping for more precise control.

Progress feedback and a refreshable light count display.

Easy integration into existing lighting or pipeline workflows.

This script is especially useful for lighting TDs, compositors preparing for AOV-based relighting, and teams working in collaborative environments where consistent naming conventions matter.

To use the tool, simply run the script in Maya’s Script Editor and launch the UI. Adjust your options and hit “Assign AOV Groups”—your lights will be auto-tagged with clean, consistent aiAov attributes, ready for render passes and compositing.

1. Tool Overview
The "Arnold Auto Light Group Naming Pro" script automates the assignment of AOV group names to Arnold lights and standard Maya lights in your scene. It allows you to:

Assign unique AOV group names to multiple lights.

Customize the prefix for the AOV group names.

Filter by light type (Arnold lights or standard lights).

Work with selected lights only for grouping.

Track and display progress during the assignment process.

By using this tool, you can save time, ensure consistency, and avoid manual errors when organizing your lighting AOVs for rendering and compositing.

2. Key Features and Breakdown
Let’s break down the core features and how they work:

A. Customizable Prefix for AOV Group Names
The tool allows you to define a prefix for your AOV group names. For example, you might use multiLight as a prefix, resulting in names like multiLight00, multiLight01, and so on. The script automatically increments the group name index for each light.

Use case: This feature is especially helpful when you need to generate consistent, incremented names for large groups of lights, making it easier to organize and reference AOV passes in compositing.

B. Filtering by Light Type
You can filter lights by type:

Arnold Lights: such as aiAreaLight, aiSkyDomeLight, and aiPhotometricLight.

Standard Lights: including pointLight, directionalLight, spotLight, areaLight, and volumeLight.

Use case: This filter allows you to target specific types of lights in your scene, whether you're working with Arnold-specific lights or standard Maya lights. It gives you flexibility to fine-tune the lights you want to assign AOV groups to.

C. Select Specific Lights
The option to assign groups to only selected lights in the scene gives you complete control. When you select a group of lights and run the tool, it will automatically assign incremented AOV group names to the selected lights.

Use case: This is particularly useful in complex scenes where you only need to assign AOV groups to a specific subset of lights.

D. Progress Feedback
As the script runs, you’ll see a progress bar that tracks the assignment of AOV groups. This provides immediate feedback, so you can track how many lights have been processed.

Use case: The progress bar ensures that you know exactly how long the assignment process will take, especially in scenes with a large number of lights.

E. Light Count Display
A light count display is automatically updated, showing how many lights were found in the scene based on the current filter options (Arnold or standard lights). This helps you verify that the lights being processed match your expectations.

Use case: The light count update provides useful context, especially when debugging or verifying the lights before running the script.

3. UI and Workflow
The tool is packaged with an easy-to-use UI that helps you set up and run the light grouping process quickly. Here’s a breakdown of the UI elements:

Header: Displays the tool name and creator information, providing quick reference links to the creator’s ArtStation and LinkedIn profiles.

Light Count Section: Displays the number of lights found in the scene that match the filters you’ve set.

Options Section:

Prefix Field: Customize the prefix for AOV group names.

Light Type Filters: Toggle checkboxes to filter Arnold and standard lights.

Only Selected Lights Checkbox: Choose whether to apply the grouping to all lights or only selected ones.

Tip Text: Offers a helpful tip explaining how the selected lights feature works.

Actions Section:

Assign AOV Groups Button: Executes the light grouping process based on your settings.

Refresh Light Count Button: Updates the count of lights in the scene, reflecting any changes.

4. How the Script Works
When you run the script, it does the following:

Gathers Lights: It first identifies all the lights in the scene, based on the filters you’ve set (Arnold or standard lights).

Processes Lights: For each light, it checks if the aiAov attribute exists. If it doesn’t, the script adds it. Then, it assigns the AOV group name based on the prefix and index.

Increments AOV Group Names: The group name is generated using a prefix and an incrementing index (e.g., multiLight00, multiLight01, etc.). If you’re working with selected lights, it will continue numbering each time you run the script.

Displays Progress: While the lights are being processed, the progress bar shows the current step out of the total number of lights.

Once the script finishes, you’ll receive a confirmation dialog displaying how many lights were assigned AOV groups.

5. Conclusion
By using this custom tool, you’ll drastically reduce the time it takes to assign AOV groups to lights in your scene. The intuitive UI and automated workflow let you focus on what matters—lighting and rendering—while the tool handles the repetitive task of organizing AOVs for compositing.

Whether you’re working with Arnold lights, standard Maya lights, or a combination of both, this tool ensures consistent naming conventions, easy integration into your pipeline, and smoother collaboration with other departments.
